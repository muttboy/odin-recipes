    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups cooked jasmine rice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/4 large Vidalia onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves of minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen peas and carrots</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>Green onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your rice according to package directions. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or wok, heat vegetable oil over medium heat and add onion and garlic. Cook until onions are soft, about 2 to 3 minutes. Make sure to stir occasionally to keep 
            the garlic from burning. Add peas and carrots and cook until partially thawed, 1 to 2 minutes. You’ll need to adjust this time if you use fresh veggies.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat up to medium-high and add cooked rice. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes until rice is nice and hot and starts to brown.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat and push the rice to the sides of the pan, making a hole in the center of the pan for the eggs. Crack eggs into the bottom of the pan. </li>
        <li>Scramble the eggs in the middle of the pan. Once eggs are cooked, stir the cooked egg into the rice.</li>
        <li>Mix soy sauce and sesame oil together and pour over rice. Stir until rice is evenly coated with sauce.</li>
        <li>To serve this fried rice, top with chopped green onions. You could even use cilantro and toasted sesame seeds as additional toppings.</li>
    </ol>
